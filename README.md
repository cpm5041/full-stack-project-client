## Timetable

Initial (and proudly followed) timetable:

4/21-4/23- Decide project, Logic and plannning, wireframes
4/24-4/25- Basic Client creation of initial HTML,CSS
4/26-4/30- API work during project time
5/1- Wrap up and bug testing
5/2- Enhancements

My approach was to begin on my styling using bootstrap ahead of project worktime.
I feel this was very advantageous as I was able to do the styling I wanted
without cutting into project worktime which I used to focus on the API.
